| [invalidateAuth()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#invalidateAuth()) | Invalidates the authorization the effective user has to execute the current script. Used to invalidate any permissions for the current script. This is especially useful for functions tagged as one-shot authorization. Since one-shot authorization functions can only be called the first run after the script has acquired authorization, if you wish to perform an action afterwards, you must revoke any authorization the script had, so the user can see the authorization dialog again. |  |  | not started |  |
| [newStateToken()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#newStateToken()) | Creates a builder for a state token that can be used in a callback API (like an OAuth flow). | [StateTokenBuilder](#class-statetokenbuilder) | An object used to continue the state-token-building process. | not started |  |
| [newTrigger(String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#newTrigger(String)) | Begins the process of creating an installable trigger that, when fired, calls a given function. | [TriggerBuilder](#class-triggerbuilder) | An object used to continue the trigger-building process. | not started |  |
| [requireAllScopes(AuthMode)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#requireAllScopes(AuthMode)) | Validates if the user has granted consent for all of the scopes requested by the script. Use this method if an execution flow relies on all of the scopes that a script requests. If any consents are missing, then this method ends the current execution and renders an authorization prompt to request the missing consents. |  |  | completed | [link](../src/services/scriptapp/app.js#L39) |
| [requireScopes(AuthMode,String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/script-app#requireScopes(AuthMode,String)) |  |  |  | completed | [link](../src/services/scriptapp/app.js#L46) |

## Enum: [AuthMode](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/auth-mode)

An enumeration that identifies which categories of authorized services Apps Script is able to execute through a triggered function. These values are exposed in triggered functions as the authMode property of the event parameter, e. For more information, see the guide to the authorization lifecycle for add-ons.

| Property | Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| CUSTOM_FUNCTION | A mode that allows access to a limited subset of services for use in custom spreadsheet functions. Some of these services — including read-only access to Spreadsheet service — normally require authorization, but are permitted without authorization when used in a custom function. Because custom functions do not include an event parameter, this value is never returned; it is documented only to demonstrate that custom functions run in their own authorization mode. | not started |  |
| FULL | A mode that allows access to all services that require authorization. This mode occurs when an add-on or a script executes as the result of any trigger other than the cases described for LIMITED or NONE. | not started |  |
| LIMITED | A mode that allows access to a limited subset of services. This mode occurs when an add-on or a script bound to a document executes an onOpen(e) or onEdit(e) simple trigger, except in the case described for NONE. | not started |  |
| NONE | A mode that does not allow access to any services that require authorization. This mode occurs when an add-on executes an onOpen(e) simple trigger, and the user has installed an add-on in a different document but the add-on has not been used in the current document. | not started |  |

## Enum: [AuthorizationStatus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/authorization-status)

An enumeration denoting the authorization status of a script.

| Property | Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| NOT_REQUIRED | The user has granted this script all the authorization it currently requires. | not started |  |
| REQUIRED | The user needs to authorize this script to use one or more services. In most cases, the script prompts the user for authorization the next time it runs; however, if the script is published as an add-on that uses installable triggers, the trigger runs the script without prompting for authorization but throws an exception if the script attempts to call the unauthorized service. | not started |  |

## Enum: [EventType](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/event-type)

An enumeration denoting the type of triggered event.

| Property | Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| CLOCK | The trigger fires once the time-driven event reaches a specific time. | not started |  |
| ON_CHANGE | The trigger fires once the user changes the Google Sheets file (for example, by adding a row, which counts as a change instead of an edit). | not started |  |
| ON_EDIT | The trigger fires once the user edits the Google Sheets file (for example, by entering a new value into a cell, which counts as an edit instead of a change). | not started |  |
| ON_EVENT_UPDATED | The trigger fires once an event gets created, updated, or deleted on the specified Google Calendar. | not started |  |
| ON_FORM_SUBMIT | The trigger fires once the user responds to a Google Form. This trigger is available either in the Google Form itself or in the Google Sheets file that the form sends its responses to. | not started |  |
| ON_OPEN | The trigger fires once the user opens the Google Docs, Sheets, or Forms file. | not started |  |

## Enum: [InstallationSource](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/installation-source)

## Enum: [TriggerSource](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/script/trigger-source)

An enumeration denoting the source of the event that causes the trigger to fire.

| Property | Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
| CALENDAR | Google Calendar causes the trigger to fire. | not started |  |
