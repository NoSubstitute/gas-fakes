# [Cache](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache)

This service allows a script to temporarily cache results that take time to fetch/compute. Public caches are for things that are not dependent on which user is accessing your script. Private caches are for things which are user-specific, like settings or recent activity.

## Class: [Cache](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache)

A reference to a particular cache.

## Class: [CacheService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service)

CacheService allows you to access a cache for short term storage of data.

|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [getDocumentCache()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getDocumentCache()) | Gets the cache instance scoped to the current document and script. Document caches are specific to the current document which contains the script. Use these to store script information that is specific to the current document. If this method is called outside of the context of a containing document (such as from a standalone script or web app), this method returns null. | [Cache](#class-cache) | a document cache instance, or null if there is no containing document | in progress | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L157) |
| [getScriptCache()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getScriptCache()) | Gets the cache instance scoped to the script. Script caches are common to all users of the script. Use these to store information that is not specific to the current user. | [Cache](#class-cache) | a script cache instance | in progress | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L175) |
| [getUserCache()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/cache/cache-service#getUserCache()) | Gets the cache instance scoped to the current user and script. User caches are specific to the current user of the script. Use these to store script information that is specific to the current user. | [Cache](#class-cache) | a user cache instance | in progress | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L167) |
