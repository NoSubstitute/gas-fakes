# Gas fakes progress

This folder contains progress for each apps script service. Each service, for example Forms has a file called Forms.MD.  

In that file there's a summary of the service, a link to the docs and a tables describing the methods as desribed in the prompt below. Note that all links should be in markdown format like this - [label](http://example.com)



### Prompt for Regenerating Forms Service Progress Documentation (Precise)

To accurately regenerate the Forms Service progress documentation in `/home/bruce/gas-fakes/progress/Forms.MD`, follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify all classes** listed in the official Google Apps Script Forms Service documentation (https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms). Include all classes, regardless of their current implementation status in `gas-fakes`.
2.  **Process one class at a time** to ensure accuracy.
3.  For each class, generate a complete markdown section with the following structure and rules:
    *   **Class Heading**:
        *   Start with a Level 2 Markdown heading (`##`).
        *   The class name itself **must** be a markdown link to its official documentation URL. Example: `## FormApp`
    *   **Class Summary**:
        *   On a new line, add the brief summary of the class's purpose from the official documentation.
    *   **Completion Percentage**:
        *   On a new line, add the calculated completion percentage, formatted exactly as `XX% completed`.

4.  **Create a Markdown Table** immediately following the header with these columns: `method`, `return`, `status`, `comments`.

5.  **Populate the table** for each method in the class with the following strict formatting rules:
    *   **`method` column**:
        *   The method name **must** be a markdown link to its *specific* official Apps Script documentation page.
        *   The link text must be the method name with its parentheses, for example `create(title)`.
        *   **Crucially, do NOT add extra parentheses** to the method name inside the link text. It must be `create(title)`, not `create(title))`.
        *   **Do NOT use backticks (`)** around the link.
    *   **`return` column**:
        *   If the return type is another class within the Forms Service (e.g., `CheckboxItem`), it **must** be a local markdown link to its corresponding section within `Forms.MD`. Example: `CheckboxItem`.
        *   If it's an external class (e.g., `Ui`), link to its official documentation. Example: `Ui`.
        *   For primitive types (`String`, `Boolean`, `Integer`), use plain text.
        *   **Do NOT use backticks (`)** around return types.
    *   **`status` column**: Determine the status (`Completed`, `In Progress`, `Not Started`) by checking the implementation in `src/services/*. Note that many classes inherit methods as an extension of other classes. To determine if a method is completete, you'll need to search through the classes inhertance chain and only mark it as completed if a concrete implementation of the method is found.
    *   **`comments` column**: Leave empty unless there is a specific issue to reference.

6.  **Assemble the Final File**:
    *   Start with the main heading: `# Forms Service Progress`.
    *   Add the general documentation link: `**Documentation:** Forms Service`.
    *   Add a horizontal rule (`---`).
    *   Append each correctly formatted class section, separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).
    *   The final output should be the **full content** for `Forms.MD`, not a diff.

There's no need to try to amend the content of the existing Forms.MD as it is not user maintained. It's 100% generated by you. You can simply create a new version.
