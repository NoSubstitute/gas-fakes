This repo, gas-fakes, is attempting to recreate the Apps Script environment on Node.

Follow the instructions below to create progress documentation for a given Apps Script service.

### Prompt for Regenerating Service Progress Documentation

To accurately regenerate the progress documentation for any Apps Script service, follow these steps precisely:

1.  **Identify all classes** listed in the official Google Apps Script documentation for the service. Include all classes, regardless of their current implementation status in `gas-fakes`.

2.  **Locate the source code** for the service implementation. The primary location is `/home/bruce/gas-fakes/src/services/<service-name>`. Also, check for relevant files in `/home/bruce/gas-fakes/src/services/common/`.

3.  **Process one class at a time** to ensure accuracy.

4.  For each class, generate a complete markdown section with the following structure and rules:
    *   **Class Heading**:
        *   Start with a Level 2 Markdown heading (`##`).
        *   The class name itself **must** be a markdown link to its official documentation URL. Example: `## [ClassName](doc_url)`
    *   **Class Summary**:
        *   On a new line, add the brief summary of the class's purpose from the official documentation.
    *   **Completion Percentage**:
        *   On a new line, add the calculated completion percentage, formatted exactly as `XX% completed`. The percentage is calculated as `(number of completed methods / total number of methods) * 100`.

5.  **Create a Markdown Table** immediately following the header with these columns: `method`, `return`, `status`, `comments`.

6.  **Populate the table** for each method in the class with the following strict formatting rules:
    *   **`method` column**:
        *   The method name **must** be a markdown link to its *specific* official Apps Script documentation page.
        *   The link text must be the method name with its parentheses, for example `create(title)`.
        *   **Crucially, do NOT add extra parentheses** to the method name inside the link text. It must be `create(title)`, not `create(title))`.
        *   **Do NOT use backticks (`)** around the link.
    *   **`return` column**:
        *   If the return type is another class within the same service (e.g., `CheckboxItem`), it **must** be a local markdown link to its corresponding section within the same document. The link should be all lowercase. Example: `[CheckboxItem](#checkboxitem)`.
        *   If it's an external class (e.g., `Ui`), link to its official documentation. Example: `[Ui](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui)`.
        *   For primitive types (`String`, `Boolean`, `Integer`), use plain text.
        *   **Do NOT use backticks (`)** around return types.
    *   **`status` column**: Determine the status (`Completed`, `In Progress`, `Not Started`) by checking the implementation in the source code. Note that many classes inherit methods as an extension of other classes. To determine if a method is complete, you'll need to search through the class's inheritance chain and only mark it as completed if a concrete implementation of the method is found. Some methods are also created via a factory approach so are not explicitly set in the class, but rather are generated in the constructor. These type of methods must also be included.
    *   **`comments` column**: Leave empty unless there is a specific issue to reference.

7.  **Assemble the Final File**:
    *   Start with the main heading: `# ServiceName Service Progress - XX% completed`. The overall completion percentage is calculated as `(total number of completed methods in the service / total number of methods in the service) * 100`.
    *   Add the general documentation link: `**Documentation:** [ServiceName Service](doc_url)`.
    *   Add a horizontal rule (`---`).
    *   Append each correctly formatted class section, separated by a horizontal rule (`---`).
    *   The final output should be the **full content** for the markdown file, not a diff.

There's no need to try to amend the content of the existing markdown files as they are not user maintained. They are 100% generated by you. You can simply create a new version.
