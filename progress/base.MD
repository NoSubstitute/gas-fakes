|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [getActiveUser()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/session#getActiveUser()) | Gets information about the current user. If security policies do not allow access to the user's identity, User.getEmail() returns a blank string. The circumstances in which the email address is available vary: for example, the user's email address is not available in any context that allows a script to run without that user's authorization, like a simple onOpen(e) or onEdit(e) trigger, a custom function in Google Sheets, or a web app deployed to "execute as me" (that is, authorized by the developer instead of the user). However, these restrictions generally do not apply if the developer runs the script themselves or belongs to the same Google Workspace domain as the user. | [User](#class-user) | the current user | completed | [link](../src/services/session/fakesession.js#L9) |
| [getActiveUserLocale()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/session#getActiveUserLocale()) | Gets the language setting of the current user as a stringâ€”for example, en for English. | String | a string that represents the user's language setting | completed | [link](../src/services/session/fakesession.js#L22) |
| [getEffectiveUser()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/session#getEffectiveUser()) | Gets information about the user under whose authority the script is running. If the script is a web app set to "execute as me" (the developer), this returns the developer's user account. If the script is running under an installable trigger, this returns the account of the user who created the trigger. In most other scenarios, this returns the same account as getActiveUser(). | [User](#class-user) | the user under whose authority the script is running | completed | [link](../src/services/session/fakesession.js#L16) |
| [getScriptTimeZone()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/session#getScriptTimeZone()) | Gets the time zone of the script. New scripts default to the owner's time zone, but the script's time zone can be changed by clicking File > Project properties in the script editor. Note that spreadsheets have a separate time zone, which can be changed by clicking File > Spreadsheet settings in Google Sheets. Spreadsheet time zones that differ from the script time zone are a frequent source of scripting bugs. | String | the time zone of the script | completed | [link](../src/services/session/fakesession.js#L32) |
| [getTemporaryActiveUserKey()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/session#getTemporaryActiveUserKey()) | Gets a temporary key that is unique to the active user but does not reveal the user identity. The temporary key rotates every 30 days and is unique to the script. | String | the temporary active user key | completed | [link](../src/services/session/fakesession.js#L40) |

## Class: [Ui](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui)

An instance of the user-interface environment for a Google App that allows the script to add features like menus, dialogs, and sidebars. A script can only interact with the UI for the current instance of an open editor, and only if the script is container-bound to the editor.

| Method | Description | Return Type | Return Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [alert(String,ButtonSet)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#alert(String,ButtonSet)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [alert(String,String,ButtonSet)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#alert(String,String,ButtonSet)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [alert(String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#alert(String)) | Opens a dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and an "OK" button. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but Jdbc connections and LockService locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars. | [Button](#enum-button) | The button the user clicked. | not started |  |
| [createAddonMenu()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#createAddonMenu()) | Creates a builder that can be used to insert a sub-menu into the editor's Extensions menu. The menu isn't actually be updated until Menu.addToUi() is called. If the script is running as an add-on, the sub-menu name matches the add-on's name in the web store; if the script is bound to the document directly, the sub-menu name matches the script's name. For more information, see the guide to menus. | [Menu](#class-menu) | The new menu builder. | not started |  |
| [createMenu(String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#createMenu(String)) | Creates a builder that can be used to add a menu to the editor's user interface. The menu isn't actually be added until Menu.addToUi() is called. For more information, see the guide to menus. The label for a top-level menu should be in headline case (all major words capitalized), although the label for a sub-menu should be in sentence case (only the first word capitalized). If the script is published as an add-on, the caption parameter is ignored and the menu is added as a sub-menu of the Extensions menu, equivalent to createAddonMenu(). | [Menu](#class-menu) | The new menu builder. | not started |  |
| [prompt(String,ButtonSet)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#prompt(String,ButtonSet)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [prompt(String,String,ButtonSet)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#prompt(String,String,ButtonSet)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [prompt(String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#prompt(String)) | Opens an input dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and an "OK" button. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but Jdbc connections and LockService locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars. | [PromptResponse](#class-promptresponse) | A representation of the user's response. | not started |  |
| [showModalDialog(Object,String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#showModalDialog(Object,String)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [showModelessDialog(Object,String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#showModelessDialog(Object,String)) |  |  |  | not started |  |
| [showSidebar(Object)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui#showSidebar(Object)) | Opens a sidebar in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does not suspend the server-side script while the sidebar is open. To communicate with the server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the google.script API for HtmlService. To close the sidebar programmatically, call google.script.host.close() on the client side of an HtmlService web app. For more information, see the guide to dialogs and sidebars. |  |  | not started |  |

## Class: [User](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/user)

If security policies do not allow access to the user's email address, this method returns a blank string. The circumstances in which the email address is available vary: for example, the user's email address is not available in any context that allows a script to run without that user's authorization, like a simple onOpen(e) or onEdit(e) trigger, a custom function in Google Sheets, or a web app deployed to "execute as me" (that is, authorized by the developer instead of the user). However, these restrictions generally do not apply if the developer runs the script themselves or belongs to the same Google Workspace domain as the user. | String | The user's email's address, or a blank string if security policies do not allow access to the user's email address. | completed | [link](../src/services/common/fakeuser.js#L5) |

| [getAs(String)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/blob-source#getAs(String)) | Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This method adds the appropriate extension to the filenameâ€”for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes "ShoppingList.12.25.pdf". | [Blob](#class-blob) | The data as a blob. | not started |  |
| [getBlob()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/blob-source#getBlob()) | Return the data inside this object as a blob. | [Blob](#class-blob) | The data as a blob. | not started |  |
