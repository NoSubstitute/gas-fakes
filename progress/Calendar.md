For non–all-day events, this is the instant in time at which the event was defined to start. For all-day events, which only store a start date (not a date and time), this is midnight at the beginning of the day on which the event starts in the calendar's time zone. This allows meaningful comparison of start times for all types of events; however, it is not necessarily preserve the original day-of-year unmodified. | Date | this calendar event's start time | not started |  |
