## Class: [FormResponse](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response)

A response to the form as a whole. A FormResponse can be used in three ways: to access the answers submitted by a respondent (see getItemResponses()), to programmatically submit a response to the form (see withItemResponse(response) and submit()), and to generate a URL for the form which pre-fills fields using the provided answers. FormResponses can be created or accessed from a Form.

| Method | Description | Return Type | Return Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [getEditResponseUrl()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getEditResponseUrl()) | Generates a URL that can be used to edit a response that has already been submitted. If the Form.setAllowResponseEdits(enabled) setting is disabled, the link leads to a page that explains that editing form responses is disabled. Anyone who visits the link can edit the response, although they need an account with access to the form if the Form.setRequireLogin(requireLogin) setting is enabled. If the Form.setCollectEmail(collect) setting is enabled, the form records the email address of the user who edited the response instead of the email address of the original respondent. | String | The URL to change a submitted response. | not started |  |
| [getGradableItemResponses()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getGradableItemResponses()) | Gets all item responses contained in a form response, in the same order that the items appear in the form. This method works similarly to getItemResponses(), but to allow for grading a missing answer, it still returns an ItemResponse if the corresponding Item can be graded (that is, has a point value), even if there isn't an actual response. However, if the Item isn't gradable, this method excludes that item from its returned array. | [ItemResponse[]](#class-itemresponse) | An array of responses to every question item within the form for which the respondent could receive a score. | not started |  |
| [getGradableResponseForItem(Item)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getGradableResponseForItem(Item)) | Gets the item response contained in a form response for a given item. This method works similarly to getResponseForItem(item), but to allow for grading a missing answer, it still returns an ItemResponse if the corresponding Item can be graded (that is, has a point value), even if there isn't an actual response. However, if the Item isn't gradable, this method returns null. | [ItemResponse](#class-itemresponse) | The response for a given item, or null if none exists and the item is ungraded. | not started |  |
| [getId()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getId()) | Gets the ID of the form response. This method returns null if the form response has not been submitted. | String | The ID of the form response, or null if the form response has not been submitted. | not started |  |
| [getItemResponses()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getItemResponses()) | Gets all item responses contained in a form response, in the same order that the items appear in the form. If the form response does not contain a response for a given TextItem, DateItem, TimeItem, or ParagraphTextItem, the ItemResponse returned for that item will have an empty string as the response. If the form response omits a response for any other item type, this method excludes that item from its returned array. | [ItemResponse[]](#class-itemresponse) | An array of responses to every question item within the form for which the respondent provided an answer. | not started |  |
| [getRespondentEmail()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getRespondentEmail()) | Gets the email address of the person who submitted a response, if the Form.setCollectEmail(collect) setting is enabled. | String | The email address of the person who submitted this response, if available, or null if the script created this response but has not yet submitted it. | not started |  |
| [getResponseForItem(Item)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getResponseForItem(Item)) | Gets the item response contained in this form response for a given item. | [ItemResponse](#class-itemresponse) | The response for a given item, or null if none exists. | not started |  |
| [getTimestamp()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#getTimestamp()) | Gets the timestamp for a form response submission. | Date | The timestamp at which this response was submitted, or null if the script created this response but has not yet submitted it. | not started |  |

Throws a scripting exception if the response has already been submitted. | [FormResponse](#class-formresponse) | A newly created response saved to the form's response store. | not started |  |
| [toPrefilledUrl()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#toPrefilledUrl()) | Generates a URL for the form in which the answers are pre-filled based on the answers in this form response. | String | The URL for a form with pre-filled answers. | not started |  |
| [withItemGrade(ItemResponse)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#withItemGrade(ItemResponse)) | Adds the given item response's grades to a form response. This method applies only to form responses that have already been submitted, and only affects stored grades once they are submitted. This method also only updates the item response's grades; it does not affect the actual response (since the response has already been submitted). If this method is called multiple times for the same item, only the last grade is retained. If the ItemResponse contains no grades, this method removes grades for the item. | [FormResponse](#class-formresponse) | this FormResponse, for chaining | not started |  |
| [withItemResponse(ItemResponse)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-response#withItemResponse(ItemResponse)) | Adds the given item response to a form response. This method applies only to form responses that the script has created but not yet submitted; it cannot affect stored responses. If this method is called multiple times for the same item, only the last item response is retained. | [FormResponse](#class-formresponse) | This FormResponse, for chaining. | not started |  |
