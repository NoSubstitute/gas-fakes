# [Properties](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties)

This service allows scripts to store strings as key-value pairs scoped to one script, one user of a script, or one document in which an editor add-on is used. For more information about when to use each type of property, see the guide to the Properties service.

## Class: [Properties](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties)

The properties object acts as the interface to access user, document, or script properties. The specific property type depends on which of the three methods of PropertiesService the script called: PropertiesService.getDocumentProperties(), PropertiesService.getUserProperties(), or PropertiesService.getScriptProperties(). Properties cannot be shared between scripts. For more information about property types, see the guide to the Properties service.

| [getProperties()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties#getProperties()) | Gets a copy of all key-value pairs in the current Properties store. Note that the returned object is not a live view of the store.

## Class: [PropertiesService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service)

Allows scripts to store simple data in key-value pairs scoped to one script, one user of a script, or one document in which an add-on is used. Properties cannot be shared between scripts. For more information about when to use each type of property, see the guide to the Properties service.

| Method | Description | Return Type | Return Description | Status | Implementation |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| [getDocumentProperties()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service#getDocumentProperties()) | Gets a property store (for this script only) that all users can access within the open document, spreadsheet, or form. It is only available if the script is published and executing as an add-on or if it is bound to a Google file type. When document properties are not available this method returns null. Document properties created by a script are not accessible outside that script, even by other scripts accessing the same document. | [Properties](#class-properties) | a property store for this script only that all users of the current document can access, or null if the script is not either an add-on or bound to a Google Workspace file | completed | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L121) |
| [getScriptProperties()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service#getScriptProperties()) | Gets a property store that all users can access, but only within this script. | [Properties](#class-properties) | a property store that all users of the script can access | completed | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L139) |
| [getUserProperties()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/properties/properties-service#getUserProperties()) | Gets a property store that only the current user can access, and only within this script. | [Properties](#class-properties) | a property store that only the current user of the script can access | completed | [link](../src/services/stores/fakestores.js#L131) |
